# This config-file is only needed for development. Instead of changing the url
# everytime you work locally on the project, you start both config-files, overwriting
# the first one with the development variables needed.
#
# Start development with â€º $ bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_dev.yml
# Use the --drafts flag to show draft posts
# Use the --unpublished flag to show posts and pages marked as unpublished (published: false in the front matter).
